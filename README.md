# turbot_utils

This is some basic python code that I have started working on to manage the turbot cluster that I am working on.

At the inception of this project TurbotHQ had not yet released a Python API I have gone ahead and created an initial one so I did not have to constantly write REST commands into my scripts.

Currently this is being written in Python3.6 but an effort is being made to allow it to work on Python2.7 as well.
